# Dear Hiring Team

**Tools for people who are tired of pretending the hiring market makes sense.**

[DearHiring.team](DearHiring.team) is a set of tools for job seekers who want to **understand** what is happening with their applications instead of blindly spraying résumés and guessing why nothing works.

We are not here to “fix” the hiring market. We make it observable.

## Why this exists

Modern hiring looks like this:

- dozens or hundreds of applications
- opaque ATS filters no one admits to using
- template rejections or complete silence
- advice like “be yourself” and “improve your CV”

The problem is not the candidates. The problem is the lack of feedback, structure, and data.

[DearHiring.team](DearHiring.team) was born out of personal frustration and engineering stubbornness.

## What DearHiring.team does

- **Application tracking**  
  Where you applied, when, how, and with what outcome. Without Excel gymnastics.

- **Job search funnel analytics**  
  Where you get filtered out: instantly, after screening, or after interviews.

- **Deliberate résumé adaptation**  
  Not spam. Precise tuning for a specific role and context.

## What this project deliberately avoids

- ❌ Mass auto-apply features  
- ❌ “ATS hacks” and filter bypass myths  
- ❌ Motivational fairy tales  
- ❌ Selling hope instead of clarity  

If you are looking for a magic button, this is not it.

## Project status

The project is actively developed. It is used in real job searches. Features come from practice, not pitch decks.

Public repositories and documentation will be added gradually.

## Who this is for

Engineers, analysts, and other white collar grown-ups who:
- value clarity over hype
- want to see the system, not just outcomes
- are tired of noise and empty promises

## Author’s stance

[DearHiring.team](DearHiring.team) is not an “AI startup”. It is an engineering response to a broken process.

If the market refuses to explain its rules, they have to be reconstructed.
